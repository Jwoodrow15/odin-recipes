            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon whole milk</li>
                <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
                <li>1 pint heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>18-inch squares cheesecloth</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>  
                <li>Line a large colander or sieve with 4 layers of cheesecloth. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat milk, buttermilk, heavy cream, and salt in a large, heavy, nonreactive saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally for the first 10 minutes. Continue heating, without stirring, until the temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove from heat and let stand for 1 hour. The mixture will be separated into white curds and clear whey.</li>
                <li>Using a slotted spoon, ladle approximately 1/4 of the curds into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Gather up the corners of the top cheesecloth and secure closed with a zip tie. Repeat with the rest of the curds, cheesecloth, and zip ties. Use the last zip tie to thread all of the cheeses together. Suspend the cheeses over a large wooden spoon over a large bowl, and let drain for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Place the four cheeses, still in cloth, in a bowl in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, cut zip ties, and transfer cheese to an airtight container.</li>
